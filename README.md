# Custom Productivity App

The Custom Productivity App is a personal productivity tool designed to help users manage tasks, track progress, and optimize daily workflow. It is currently in active development.
> **Note:** This app was built with the assistance of AI coding agents to accelerate development and try out modern tools.

## Features

- **Time Tracking:** Create projects with tasks and track how much time you spend on each. Easily view your time spent on everything in a timesheet and in the dedicated Reports tab (with visualizations). 
- **Organization:** Organize various aspects of your life with to-do lists, daily & weekly goal tracking or grocery lists.
- **Health:** Track your weight over custom timeframes or count how many calories you eat daily. 
- **Backup/Restore Feature:** Users can backup all their data by creating a simple JSON file, which can be used to restore or transfer their data to a different device.
- **Data Protection:** All data is stored locally on your own device unless you decide to share the backup files. 

## Technology

- **TypeScript:** Strongly-typed codebase for reliability and maintainability.
- **Expo & React Native:** Modern framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
