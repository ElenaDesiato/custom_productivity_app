# Productivity App Project Rules

## 1. Platform & Technology
- Build as a cross-platform mobile app using **React Native** (Expo) and **TypeScript**.
- Target platform: **Android** (future extensibility for iOS allowed).
- Enforce ESLint and Prettier formatting conventions.

## 2. Security & Privacy
- All user data must be stored **locally** on the device using secure storage (e.g., Expo SecureStore, SQLite, or MMKV).
- Do not use third-party analytics or tracking libraries.
- All sensitive operations (e.g., backup/restore) must use encrypted storage.

## 3. Availability & Data Integrity
- The app must function **offline** and be available 24/7 as long as the app is open on the device.
- Implement regular, automatic local backups of all user data (e.g., daily or on app close).
- Provide a manual backup/export option for the user (e.g., to a local file).

## 4. User Experience & UI
- Use **tab-based navigation** (e.g., React Navigation's Tab Navigator) with clear, simple tabs for each main feature.
- Design must be minimal, intuitive, and accessible.
- All primary actions (e.g., start/stop timer, add task) should be achievable in 1â€“2 taps.
- Use consistent, idiomatic naming and group related files into folders (e.g., `components/`, `hooks/`, `screens/`).

## 5. Time Tracking Features
- Users can start/stop a timer for a task with a single tap, then select or create a task.
- Tasks can be organized into projects.
- A "Timesheet" tab displays the current week, showing hours spent per day and per task. Tapping a day shows a summary of tasks for that day.
- A "Reports" tab provides graphical and numerical breakdowns of time spent by task/project for this week, last week, this month, last month, or a custom range.

## 6. Code Quality & Maintainability
- Write modular, reusable, and self-documenting code.
- Use comments only where necessary for clarity.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; prefer built-in or well-maintained libraries.
- Structure code for long-term maintainability and scalability.

## 7. Project Goals
1. **Personal, Secure Mobile Productivity App:** Privacy-first, single-user Android app using React Native (Expo) and TypeScript, focused on time tracking and productivity.
2. **Local-Only Data Storage:** All user data is securely stored on-device and never leaves the device or is exposed to the internet.
3. **Reliable, Always-Available Experience:** The app works offline, is always available when open, and automatically backs up user data locally.
4. **Intuitive Time Tracking:** Users can easily track time spent on tasks and projects with a simple start/stop timer and quick task selection.
5. **Organized Task & Project Management:** Tasks are organized into projects for better structure and reporting.
6. **Comprehensive Timesheet & Reporting:** Users can view weekly timesheets and generate reports (graphical and numerical) for various timeframes, with breakdowns by task and project.
7. **Simple, Tab-Based UI:** The app uses a clean, tabbed interface for easy navigation between time tracking, timesheet, and reports.
8. **Future Extensions:** The app will be extended to include productivity such as goals, calendar, todolist, etc. Make sure the UI and code reflects this and allows easy extendability.
